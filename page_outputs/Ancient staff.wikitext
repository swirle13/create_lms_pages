'''Ancient staff''' from [[Last Man Standing]] is a minigame-exclusive variant of the normal [[Ancient staff]]. It can be obtained from opening the [[Chest (Last Man Standing)|chests]] with a [[bloody key]], or looting the [[Crate (Last Man Standing)|crates]] that spawn at random locations on the map. It is dropped on death to whoever killed you.
